# SuperFun.Social (SFS) - The Creator focused gamified community platform


## Problem

Currently while engaging in social media or buying in app virtual assets, we all are being given an illusion of getting value in the form of “Likes” for our content, “Virtual assets” which we really don't own, “Rating/Reputation” which gives users nothing other than making them feel to contribute more and become a loyal user of the platform. As we all invest our time, our data,  money, and skills to participate in the network/platform through which we are getting illusions and not getting enough value for our contribution.


SuperFun.Social is a gamified community platform with the core focus of enabling people to generate value for the time they invest and the content they create, ensuring a super fun experience along the way.

## Here is what we are building: 

We all are users of Web2 who joined Web3 space but still there are our fellow members of Web2 who have not joined the Web3 party yet so our aim is to provide a Hybrid platform to make it easy for Web2 users to access the platform through easy Email & Web3 wallet Signup process and gradually help them learn the way to access Web3 ecosystem. 

 #### By using Moralis using Avalanche Blockchain, we have built: 
 1) Web and Mobile Application 💻 + 📱
 2) Super World - Metaverse 🌍. A gamified 3D experience that will leave a WOW 😍 feeling to members while having real time interaction with fellow members of the platform.
